# PowerBI_Project
An example of one of the personal finance projects I have made.

Client was based in the US and asked for a detailed visualization of household's average spending. 
She was mainly interested in how much she spends in particular categories in order to be able to make changes to her spending habits.
The provided solution included a workshop with the client on how to use and understand the solution, as well as key take-aways from the data.

The client has granted permission to use her data as an example.
